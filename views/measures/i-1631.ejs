<h2>Initiative 1631: Carbon Emissions Fee Measure </h2>

<p>Initiative 1631 would enact a carbon emissions fee on large emitters. The fee would be $15 per metric ton of carbon beginning on January 1, 2020, and would increase by $2 per metric ton each year until the state's greenhouse gas reduction goals of 2035 are met and the 2050 goals were on track to be met. Revenue from the fee would go into three funds: (1) a fund for air quality and energy programs and projects, (2) a fund for water quality and forest health projects, and (3) a fund for investments related to communities.</p>

<p> <span id="pro">Yes</span> SUPPORTS the initiative to enact a carbon emissions fee that increases until emissions targets are met.</p>

<p> <span id="con">No</span> OPPOSES the initiative to enact a carbon emissions fee that increases until emissions targets are met.</p>
